    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Purpose:</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>To explore issues of acceptable use related to Internet
      access</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Lesson:</H2>

    <P>Prior to Internet use, it is a good idea to discuss safety
    and acceptable use issues with students. In most school
    districts, an <B>Acceptable Use Policy</B> is developed and
    then signed by students (and often parents) before students are
    given access to the Internet. It is important to check this out
    in your district before allowing students to use the
    Internet.</P>

    <P>What do you think should be included in an <B>Acceptable Use
    Policy</B>? Should it include just Internet usage? Would you
    include general computer usage?</P>

    following are some links to explore regarding this topic. You
    do not need to read all of these links. Feel free to browse

    <H2>Discussion</H2>

    <P>Does your district already have an <B>Acceptable Use
    Policy</B>? What issues/items are included in the policy? Who
    signs it? Are there any items <B>not</B> included in your
    district's acceptable use policy that you feel should be
    included? Are there any items included in your district's
    acceptable use policy that you feel should <B>not</B> be
    included?</P>

    <P>Discuss or post your comments as indicated by your
    facilitator.</P>
