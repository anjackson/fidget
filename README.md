Nanite - A Tiny Droid
=====================

The Nanite project brings together a number of different format identification tools, and aims to make it easier 
to compare and combine the results.

* nanite-droid is a wrapping of the core identification functionality of DROID, and depends on the openplanets version of the DROID codebase
* nanite-tika is based on Apache Tika
* nanite-ohcount wraps the results from the Ohcount command line tool (TBA)
* nanite-combined combines the other identifiers (TBC)
* nanite-hadoop allows the various identifiers to be run on web archives via Map-Reduce on Apache Hadoop. It depends on the (W)ARC Record Readers from the WAP codebase.
