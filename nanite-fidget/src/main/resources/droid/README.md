DROID Signatures Temporary Staging Area
---------------------------------------

Please find attached the provisional DROID sigs for the .rb, .epub, and .ibooks format. Not sure of the best place to put these, so feel free to upload wherever you think is appropriate. These will make the next PRONOM release, but if people want to test now with their own collections then they are welcome to.
 
The iBooks and epub sigs are a bit more complex as they need modification to the container signature too and DROID doesnâ€™t directly provide an upload function for that, so it needs to be dropped in the container file folder, which is usually here, on XP:
 
C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\.droid6\container_sigs
 
One important caveat, is that the PUIDs contained within these signature files are not final and will change when I load the info into production upon the next release.
